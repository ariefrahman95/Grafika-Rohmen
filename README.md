==============

Collections of codes that can be used to draw things with Turbo C++.

This project uses OpenBGI library (site: http://openbgi.sourceforge.net).

We used TDM-GCC 4.8.1 (site: http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net) to compile this project. If you are going
to use other compiler, you might need to make small changes at the Makefiles.
